This user guide helps you to setup download server and session token

In this version of the example code, a local download server is used to demonstrate how to upload a large file by multiple parts to the AWS S3 server. Also, session token option is added for testing purpose.
To run the demonstration, you need to setup local download server.
To test the session token, you need to control the related macros to add the ‘x-amz-security-token’ in different positions and test all the possible combinations

Setup download server (use PC as local download server)
1)	Make sure PC and Ameba-1 are in the same network (eg. connect to the same wifi) 
2)	Place test file in the download server by adding the test file under ‘tools\DownloadServer(HTTP)’
3)	Open “tools\DownloadServer(HTTP)\start.bat” in notepad 
4)	Change file path with the name of the test file (eg. image.jpg)
5)	Run “tools\DownloadServer(HTTP)\start.bat” and wait for download request
6)	In cmd, enter ‘ipconfig’ to see the PC’s (download server) IP address (IPv4 Address)
7)	Open ‘example_s3_upload.c’
8)	Set ‘DL_File_TYPE’ to the format of test file
9)	Set ‘DL_SERVER_HOST’ to the PC’s IP address
10)	Set ‘DL_RESOURCE’ to the name of test file
11)	Set ‘S3_RESOURCE’ to the name to be shown in S3 server
12)	Compile and run ‘example_s3_upload.c’
13) Connect Ameba-1 to the same network as download server connected

Setup SESSION_TOKEN (temporary security credentials)
1)	When use session token as the credentials, set ‘SESSION_TOKEN’ as 1 in ‘example_s3_upload.c’ 
2)	Fill in ‘S3_KEY_ID’, ‘S3_KEY_SECRET’ and ‘S3_SESSION_TOKEN’ to the temporary security credentials that obtained from AWS STS
3)	Edit ‘ADD_IN_FORM_FIELD’, ‘ADD_IN_POLICY’ and ‘ADD_IN_REQUEST_HEADER’ to control where to add the ‘x-amz-security-token’ to.
4)	Edit the rest of S3 server parameters (see ‘component\common\example\s3_upload\readme.txt’)
5)	Compile and run ‘example_s3_upload.c’
